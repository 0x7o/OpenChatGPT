# Open Source ChatGPT

Welcome to the project for creating an open source equivalent of ChatGPT, the popular chatbot model developed by OpenAI. Our goal is to create a similar model that is open source and freely available for anyone to use, train, and modify.

## What is ChatGPT?

ChatGPT is a state-of-the-art language model developed by OpenAI that has shown impressive results in natural language processing tasks such as text generation and conversation. However, the model is proprietary and not available for public use.
